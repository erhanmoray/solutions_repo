# Problem 1
# üåç Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Kepler's Third Law Derivation

In a circular orbit, a body (like a planet or satellite) revolves around a much more massive object (like the Sun or Earth). The gravitational force provides the necessary **centripetal force** to maintain the orbit.

We aim to derive the relationship:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

This is known as **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law** for circular orbits.

---

## 1. Gravitational Force Acting on the Orbiting Body

According to **Newton‚Äôs Law of Universal Gravitation**, the gravitational force between two bodies is:

$$
F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2}
$$

- \( G \): Gravitational constant  
- \( M \): Mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun)  
- \( m \): Mass of the orbiting body (e.g., a planet)  
- \( r \): Orbital radius (distance between the two centers)

---

## 2. Centripetal Force Required for Circular Motion

For circular motion, the required **centripetal force** is:

$$
F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

- \( v \): Orbital speed of the smaller body

---

## 3. Equating Gravitational and Centripetal Forces

In a stable circular orbit:

$$
F_g = F_c
$$

Substituting:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

We can cancel the mass \( m \) (since it appears on both sides and is not zero):

$$
\frac{G M}{r^2} = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Multiply both sides by \( r \):

$$
\frac{G M}{r} = v^2
$$

---

## 4. Express Orbital Speed in Terms of Orbital Period

Orbital period \( T \) is the time it takes to complete one full orbit. The circumference of the orbit is \( 2\pi r \), and speed is distance over time:

$$
v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
$$

Now square both sides:

$$
v^2 = \left( \frac{2\pi r}{T} \right)^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}
$$

---

## 5. Equating the Two Expressions for \( v^2 \)

From earlier:

$$
v^2 = \frac{G M}{r} \quad \text{and} \quad v^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}
$$

Set them equal:

$$
\frac{G M}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}
$$

---

## 6. Solve for Orbital Period \( T \)

Multiply both sides by \( T^2 \) and then by \( r \):

$$
G M T^2 = 4\pi^2 r^3
$$

Now solve for \( T^2 \):

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} \cdot r^3
$$

---

## ‚úÖ Final Relationship

We conclude:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

This means that **the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius**, assuming the orbit is circular and the mass of the central body is much larger than that of the orbiting body.

This is the **mathematical form of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law**, and it holds true for many orbital systems in astronomy, especially where circular approximation is valid.

## Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Astronomical Implications

The relationship between the **orbital period** \( T \) and the **orbital radius** \( r \) of celestial bodies in circular orbits is elegantly captured by **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law**, which states:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

or, when expressed with a constant of proportionality that includes the gravitational constant \( G \) and the mass of the central body \( M \):

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

This simple yet powerful equation has numerous critical applications in astronomy and astrophysics. Below, we discuss the most important implications.

---

### üî≠ 1. Determining Planetary Masses

Rearranging the above formula allows astronomers to **calculate the mass of a central body** (such as a planet or star) if the orbital radius and period of a satellite or planet are known:

$$
M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}
$$

This is especially useful for determining the mass of:

- The Sun, based on Earth's orbital radius and period
- Planets, by observing the orbits of their moons (e.g., Jupiter‚Äôs Galilean moons)
- Exoplanets or stars in binary systems

‚úÖ **Example**: By observing a moon orbiting Jupiter, astronomers can compute Jupiter‚Äôs mass without ever sending a probe there.

---

### üìê 2. Estimating Distances in Space

Kepler's Third Law enables astronomers to **calculate distances** between objects in the solar system. For instance, if the orbital period of a newly discovered object is known, its distance from the Sun can be estimated:

$$
r = \left( \frac{G M T^2}{4\pi^2} \right)^{1/3}
$$

This is fundamental in:

- Charting the orbits of asteroids and comets
- Predicting satellite orbits
- Mapping the layout of planetary systems

üõ∞Ô∏è **In satellite dynamics**, engineers use this law to place satellites at specific orbits (e.g., geostationary orbit).

---

### üåå 3. Understanding Star Systems and Exoplanets

In binary star systems or systems with exoplanets, the gravitational effect on a visible star allows us to apply Kepler‚Äôs Law to infer the **presence and mass of unseen companions**.

- The orbital characteristics of stars wobbling due to planets can be modeled using this law.
- It supports **radial velocity** and **transit** methods in exoplanet discovery.

üåü **Kepler Space Telescope** used this principle extensively to find thousands of exoplanets.

---

### üîÅ 4. Validation of Gravitational Theories

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law, when derived from Newton‚Äôs Law of Gravitation, serves as a bridge between **classical mechanics** and **observational astronomy**.

It confirms that:

- Gravitational force governs orbital motion
- The laws are consistent across different celestial systems

![alt text](image-7.png)

üìä **Observational data** from planets and moons show extraordinary agreement with the \( T^2 \propto r^3 \) relationship, strengthening our understanding of gravitational physics.

### üß† Conclusion

The orbital period-radius relationship is not merely a mathematical curiosity ‚Äî it is one of the most **fundamental tools in astronomy**. From weighing planets and stars to mapping our solar system and discovering alien worlds, Kepler‚Äôs Third Law remains a cornerstone of celestial mechanics.

It elegantly ties time, space, and mass together in a single, testable formula:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

Its enduring relevance reminds us of the deep harmony between **mathematics** and the **universe**.
 
 # üåç Orbital Period and Orbital Radius ‚Äî Real-World Examples

The relationship between the **orbital period** \( T \) and the **orbital radius** \( r \) for celestial bodies in circular orbits is governed by **Kepler‚Äôs Third Law**, which, when derived from Newton‚Äôs Law of Universal Gravitation, takes the form:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

Here:

- \( T \) is the orbital period (in seconds),
- \( r \) is the orbital radius (in meters),
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \ \mathrm{Nm^2/kg^2}\)),
- \( M \) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Earth or the Sun).

Let‚Äôs apply this to two significant real-world examples.

![alt text](image-12.png)

---

## üåï Example 1: The Moon Orbiting the Earth

### Known Values:
- Average orbital radius of the Moon:  
  $$ r = 3.84 \times 10^8 \ \mathrm{m} $$
- Mass of Earth:  
  $$ M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{kg} $$

### Using Kepler‚Äôs Law:
$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 (3.84 \times 10^8)^3}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 5.97 \times 10^{24}}
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
T \approx 2.36 \times 10^6 \ \mathrm{s} \approx 27.3 \ \mathrm{days}
$$

‚úÖ This matches the **observed orbital period** of the Moon almost exactly. This shows how Newtonian mechanics accurately predicts satellite orbits.

---

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Example 2: Earth and Mars Orbiting the Sun

Let‚Äôs compare the orbital periods of Earth and Mars using the ratio form of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law:

$$
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^3
$$

Let:
- \( T_1 = \) Earth's period = 1 year,
- \( r_1 = \) Earth's distance from the Sun = \(1 \ \mathrm{AU}\),
- \( r_2 = \) Mars' distance from the Sun = \(1.52 \ \mathrm{AU}\)

Plugging in:

$$
\left(\frac{T_2}{1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1.52}{1}\right)^3 = 3.51
\Rightarrow T_2 = \sqrt{3.51} \approx 1.87 \ \mathrm{years}
$$

‚úÖ Again, this aligns very closely with the actual orbital period of Mars (687 days or ~1.88 years).

## üî¨ Scientific Insight

- These examples highlight the **predictive power** of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law.
- Once the mass of the central body is known, we can compute either the radius or the period of orbit.
- It applies across scales ‚Äî from satellites like the Moon to entire planets orbiting the Sun.


---

## üß† Conclusion

Real-world orbital systems, such as the Moon-Earth system or planetary orbits in the Solar System, perfectly illustrate the elegance of Kepler‚Äôs Third Law:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

Whether modeling moons, planets, or satellites, this fundamental law allows scientists and engineers to predict orbital characteristics with remarkable precision.

## üßÆ Orbital Period and Orbital Radius: Implementing a Computational Model

To validate the mathematical relationship between the **orbital period** \(T\) and the **orbital radius** \(r\) in circular motion, we can build a simple computational simulation using Newtonian physics.

The theoretical relation is derived from equating **gravitational force** and **centripetal force** for an object in circular orbit:

$$
F_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{G M m}{r^2}, \quad F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

Setting these equal:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

Canceling mass \(m\) and solving for orbital velocity \(v\):

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

The orbital period \(T\) (time for one full orbit) is given by:

$$
T = \frac{2 \pi r}{v} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}}
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M}
$$

This confirms the relationship:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

### üß™ Numerical Simulation (Model Overview)

We simulate a small object in circular orbit around a massive body using the gravitational force to update velocity and position iteratively. The simulation verifies if the object's orbital period obeys the theoretical formula.

![alt text](image-18.png)

---

### üß∞ Parameters

- \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)
- \( M \): Mass of the central body (e.g., Sun or Earth)
- \( r \): Initial orbital radius
- Time step \( \Delta t \): Small interval for updating motion
- Total simulation time: Enough to complete at least one orbit

![alt text](image-19.png)
---

### üìà Expected Results

By simulating several orbits at different radii, and measuring the periods \(T\), we expect the following:

- The log-log plot of \( T^2 \) vs. \( r^3 \) should yield a straight line.
- The slope of this line should be approximately 1, confirming Kepler‚Äôs Third Law numerically.

![alt text](image-20.png)

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

This computational approach not only visualizes orbital motion but also **numerically verifies** the theoretical relationship:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

It highlights how physical laws manifest in simulations and strengthens the connection between mathematical models and real-world orbital mechanics.
