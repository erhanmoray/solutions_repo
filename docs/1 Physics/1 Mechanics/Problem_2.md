# Problem 2 

# Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by a second-order nonlinear differential equation that incorporates damping and external forcing effects.

### Governing Equation

The differential equation describing the angular displacement  $$\theta$$ of the pendulum is given by:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + b\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \sin \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

where:
- $$\theta(t)$$
 Angular displacement as a function of time  
- $$b$$
 Damping coefficient  
- $$\frac{g}{L}$$
 Term representing gravitational acceleration over pendulum length  
- $$A$$
 Amplitude of the external driving force  
- $$\omega$$
 Angular frequency of the driving force


### Small-Angle Approximation

For small angular displacements, the nonlinear term can be approximated as:

$$
\sin \theta \approx \theta
$$

This leads to the linearized equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + b\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L} \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

This simplification allows analytical techniques to be applied for understanding the system’s behavior.

### Phase Space Representation

### General Solution

The general solution is the sum of the transient and steady-state components:

$$
\theta(t) = \theta_{\text{hom}}(t) + \theta_{\text{part}}(t)
$$


 $$\theta_{\text{hom}}(t)$$

 Homogeneous (transient) solution, describing natural damping  

 $$\theta_{\text{part}}(t)$$

 Particular (steady-state) solution, describing forced response
### Numerical Results

It shows how the angular position of the system changes with time. It shows the effect of damping and coercive force on the system.
### Resonance Conditions

Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \( omega \) approaches the natural frequency of the system:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
$$

At or near resonance:

- The amplitude of oscillations increases significantly.
- Energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum is maximized.
- System behavior may become unstable if damping is low.

Understanding resonance is essential in designing systems where oscillatory behavior must be controlled or optimized.

This graph visualizes the resonant response of the system. If the drag force is low, there will be a sudden increase in the resonant frequency.

## Analysis of Dynamics

In this analysis, we explore how the damping coefficient, driving amplitude, and driving frequency influence the motion of a forced damped pendulum. We also examine the transition between regular and chaotic motion and their physical interpretations.

### Theoretical Background

The equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is given by:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + b\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \frac{g}{L}\sin(\theta) = A\cos(\omega t)
$$

where:
- $$\theta$$ 
is the angular displacement,
- $$b$$
 is the damping coefficient,
- $$g$$
 is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $$L$$
 is the length of the pendulum,
- $$A$$
 is the driving amplitude,
- $$\omega$$
 is the driving frequency.

### Key Parameters

1. **Damping Coefficient ($$b$$):**
   - Represents the resistance to motion.
   - Higher values lead to quicker energy dissipation.
   - Influences how quickly the pendulum stabilizes.

2. **Driving Amplitude ($$A$$):**
   - Determines the external force applied to the pendulum.
   - Larger amplitudes can introduce more energy, potentially leading to chaotic behavior.

3. **Driving Frequency ($$\omega$$):**
   - The rate at which the external force is applied.
   - Can resonate with the pendulum's natural frequency, causing large oscillations.
